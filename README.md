# React Cookie Clicker Game

A cookie clicker game is a React game where a user clicks on a big cookie, earning a single cookie per click. See [DEMO](https://zeroamps.github.io/react-cookie-clicker-game/).

I created this demo because I wanted to try [Formik](https://formik.org/) together with [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) instead of [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/). Other interesting libraries I use in the project are [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) and [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/).
